# What is MAD?
MAD is a large-scale dataset collected from Movie Audio Descriptions for the Language Grounding in Videos task. It comprises a total of 384K sentences grounded in over 1.2K hours of continuous videos from 650 different and diverse movies. 

Spanning over 22 genres across 90 years of cinema history, MAD covers a broad domain of actions, locations, and scenes. Moreover, MAD inherits a diverse set of visual and linguistic content from the broad movie genres, ranging from fiction to everyday life. 

These properties yield a unique long-form grounding setup with a large linguistic vocabulary size and challenging requirements in terms of accuracy and efficiency. 



# Request access to the MAD dataset
To get access to the MAD dataset (annotations and pre-extracted features) please follow these steps:

1- Complete this form ([link](https://forms.gle/hxR4TrQPFuNGpzcr8)) and sign the NDA (Non Disclosure Agreement).

2- We will verify the correctness of the provided information. 

3- You will receive an email with a link to download all the available content.

See the data documentation [here](doc/README.md). 


# Baselines
This repository contains the code for the baselines used in the main paper. To reproduce the results and use our code follow these two links: 

- Zero Shot CLIP ([link](baselines/0ShotCLIP/))
- VLG-Net ([link](baselines/VLG-Net/))



# Support for additional visual/linguistic features
Due to copyright restrictions, we will not release the movies. 
Nonetheless, to foster new research and to keep up with constantly changing needs, the MAD team will provide support for the computation of visual/linguistic features upon request. </br>
If you are in need of a new set of features (besides those we already provide), please reach out via email or open an issue on this repo. </br>

We will soon release a docker image for simplifying this process.
